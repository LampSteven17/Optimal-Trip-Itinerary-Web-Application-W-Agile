## Retrospective

#### What went well
* Team Cohesion and Group Dynamics: 
    Our team worked exceptionally well at delegating group tasks,
    understanding who needed the most help, and adapting our individual strengths around the
    group dynamic. 
#### Potential improvements
* React.js Understanding and development: 3 of 4 members are brand new to javascript, and much more
    learning is need to help develop our skills as programmers in Javascript. 
* Identifying problems earlier: We must begin to understand which bugs are going to take more time, and 
    if a bug is unable to be fixed, developing a strategy to remove the buggy situation.
