* The team's web application is deployed on the production server (`black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu`).
* The design document is updated (`design.md`).
* The completed metrics are captured below.
* The scrums completed during each lecture are captured below.

## Policies

### Mobile First Design
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop in that order.
* Use ReactStrap for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Minimize code smells and duplication.

### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.

### Processes
* Master is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests are successful on Travis-CI.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics
**\#24 - Where Is:**
    This is an epic nessecary for future features, leftover from SPRINT1. We will be implementing this
    feature as described in previous sprints. The user will be able to enter verifiable information
    into a box, in which we will then display that selected location on the map. The location must be valid 
    latlng format, and all other information will return nothing. We will also make sure to increase 
    this feature adaptability for the coming features of SPRINT2.
    
\#32 - Server Support: - CADE

\#90 - Support Protocol Standard v2:  - AUSTIN

\#91 - Distance: - RYAN

\#98 - Standard Units: - AUSTIN

**\#101 - Map:** 
    This is an epic to be implemented in our current sprint, SPRINT2. This epic will be the graphical portion
    of distance (\#91) and Where Is (\#24). The map must scale based on the two markers selected, and place
    a line between them. The overlay will be transparent enough to be seen but not obstructive. 

\#103 - Custom Units:  - CADE
