| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| MicroServer.java:64-82 | Similar code can be made into one function with different arguments | low | Austin | |
| MicroServer.java: 97 | catch that catches every kind of exception is somewhat of a bad practice | low | Austin | |
| MicroServer.java: 119 | Multiline string might lead to errors when trying to add or alter it. Might be worth breaking it up | low | Austin | |
| RequestTrip.java: 55 | Inconsistent tabs might lead to confusion when editing function in the future | low | Austin | |
| RequestTrip.java: 53 | Somewhat of a useless function right now. Might be worth talking about if we need it right now | low | Austin | |
